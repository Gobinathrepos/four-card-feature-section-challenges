## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks you frontend mentor for this amazing project. I learn alot by building this project.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
